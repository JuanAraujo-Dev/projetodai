        <h1>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by atypical development, behavioral manifestations, deficits in communication and social interaction, repetitive and stereotyped behavior patterns, and may present a restricted repertoire of interests and activities.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">Warning signs in the child's neurodevelopment can be noticed in the first months of life, and the diagnosis is established around 2 to 3 years of age. The prevalence is higher in males.

            Identification of developmental delays, timely diagnosis of ASD, and referral to behavioral interventions and educational support at the earliest possible age, may lead to better long-term outcomes, considering brain neuroplasticity.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">It is noteworthy that timely treatment with early stimulation should be recommended in any case of suspected ASD or atypical development of the child, regardless of diagnostic confirmation.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">The etiology of autism spectrum disorder remains unknown. Scientific evidence points out that there is no single cause, but rather the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The interaction between these factors seems to be related to ASD, but it is important to note that "increased risk" is not the same as what causes environmental risk factors. Environmental factors can increase or decrease the risk of ASD in genetically predisposed people. Although none of these factors appear to have a strong correlation with increased and/or decreased risks, exposure to chemical agents, vitamin D and folic acid deficiency, substance use (such as valproic acid) during pregnancy, prematurity (with gestational age below 35 weeks), low birth weight (< 2,500 g), multiple pregnancies, maternal infection during pregnancy, and advanced parental age are considered contributing factors to the development of ASD.</p>

        <p style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">
                Evidence indicates the influence of genetic alterations with strong heritability, but it is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that produces phenotypic heterogeneity (different physical and behavioral characteristics, both in manifestation and severity). Although some genes and some alterations are being studied, it is worth noting that there is no specific biomarker for ASD.
        </p>
        <br>   
        <h2>Diagnosis:</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">The diagnosis of ASD is essentially clinical, based on the child's observations, interviews with parents and the application of specific instruments. Child development surveillance instruments are sensitive for detecting alterations suggestive of ASD, and should be properly applied during childcare consultations in Primary Health Care. The family's report/complaint about changes in the child's development or behavior has a positive correlation with later diagnostic confirmation, so valuing the family's report/complaint is essential during the child's care.
            Acute manifestations may occur and, frequently, what we can observe are symptoms of agitation and/or aggressiveness, and there may be self- or heteroaggressiveness. These manifestations occur for several reasons, such as difficulty in communicating something you would like, some pain, some sensory discomfort, among others. In these moments, it is essential to try to understand the reason for the behaviors we are observing, in order to propose strategies that can be effective. Among the possible procedures are: behavioral strategies for behavior modification, use of supplementary and/or alternative communication as support for comprehension/expression, sensory strategies, and also more invasive procedures, such as physical and mechanical restraint, medications and, in some situations, interventions in urgency/emergency units.</p>

        <p style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the result of physical and functional changes in the brain and is related to motor, language and behavioral development.  ASD affects a child's behavior. The first signs can be noticed in babies in the first months of life. In general, a child with autism spectrum disorder may exhibit the following signs: Difficulty interacting socially, such as maintaining eye contact, identifying facial expressions and understanding communicative gestures, expressing one's emotions, and making friends. Difficulty in communication, characterized by repetitive use of language and difficulty initiating and maintaining a dialogue. Behavioral changes, such as manias, excessive attachment to routines, repetitive actions, intense interest in specific things, and difficulty imagining. If you think that your child (or the child for whom you are responsible) is not developing according to the milestones presented in the child's booklet, seek a health professional from Primary Health Care (Posto or Básica Unit). It is in this place that the initial assessment and definition of the need for referral to a specialist should be made. 

            Although there is still no cure, ASD can be treated in a number of ways. With the support of a multidisciplinary team (different professionals), the child can develop ways of communicating socially and having greater emotional stability.</p>

        <h2>My son has been diagnosed with ASD. What should I do?</h2>
        <br>
        <p  style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">The indicated conduct will depend on the severity of the disorder and the age of the child, as well as should be decided with the parents and shared with the school.  

            The sooner treatment is started, the better the development and quality of life of people with ASD.</p>
